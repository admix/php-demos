# Functional Programming

Since PHP 5.3,  supports first-class functions letting you create lexical closures and anonymous functions that can be passed around to support terser and more semantic programming. 

These examples include using [`array_filter()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-filter.php) to filter out values from an array and [`array_map()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-map.php) which lets you apply a function to each element of a list.
